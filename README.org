* Description
This is my personal Doom Emacs configuration. I've been a vim and neovim user for many years focusing on the core set of vim features with minimal use of plugins (yeah, I know, this is a big change).

This configuration hopefully reflects that at least a little bit, and will continue to do so even more in the future as I whittle down Doom Emacs to a smaller feature set over time.

** Features
Here are a few features of this configuration:

+ Starts maximized but not fullscreen (macOS)
+ Load private information from secrets file
+ Sets a random custom Doom Emacs banner at start
  - Pixelmator Pro template available on request
+ Sets snipe mode to not override =S= and =s=
+ Elixir autoformatting
+ Elixir Language Server support
  - This requires additional setup, see [[#setup-elixir-ls][Setup Elixir LS]] below
  - I'm still debating the benefits of the full language server verses just using [[https://github.com/tonini/alchemist.el][Alchemist]] which still provides quite a bit more functionality than I'm used to in my vim setup (which is basically only syntax highlighting and autoformatting)
  - If you don't want to use the language server, simple change =(elixir +lsp)= to =elixir= in =init.el= and this will use [[https://github.com/tonini/alchemist.el][Alchemist]] instead
+ Vim Vinegar style =-= keybinding to open Dired

* Prerequisites
** Fonts
+ [[https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.1.0/FiraCode.zip][FiraCode Nerd Font]] (from [[https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads][nerdfonts.com]])
+ [[https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/design/resources/download/SF-Font-Pro.dmg][San Francisco Pro]] (from [[https://developer.apple.com/fonts/][Apple Developer Fonts]])
  - This is used for tabs and treemacs. It matches the system font on macOS

** Setup Elixir LS
These steps are taken from [[https://dev.to/mariomazo/elixir-and-doom-emacs-m29][this blog post]]
*** Install the language server
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/elixir-lsp/elixir-ls.git ~/.config/elixir-ls
cd ~/.config/elixir-ls
mix deps.get
mix compile
mix elixir_ls.release -o release
#+end_src
*** Add elixir-ls to your path
Add elixir-ls to your =PATH=
#+begin_src shell
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.elixir-ls/release
#+end_src
*** Add your env variables to doom
You need to add your environment to doom so that it has access to your path
#+begin_src shell
doom env
#+end_src
*** Activate lsp and elixir with lsp support
In [[file:init.el][init.el]] make sure that =lsp= is active as well as elixir's lsp flag =(elixir +lsp)=
*** Sync doom to install packages
#+begin_src shell
doom sync
#+end_src
*** Restart emacs
Open an elixir project and look for the üöÄ in your status bar
If you need to troubleshoot, use =SPC b B= and open =*lsp-log*= to see any error messages
*** Additional config
I have turned off lsp file watching in [[file:config.el][config.el]] since I was tired of it asking every time I opened a large project. Turn it back on if you want
A better way would be to figure out how to get it to ignore certain files (like node dependencies, for instance), but I haven't gotten around to that yet

* Todo
+ Configure Org Capture
+ Sync Google Calendar with Org Agenda
  - Two-way sync preferred

* Troubleshooting
üçÄ Good luck!
