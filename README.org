* Description
This is my personal Doom Emacs configuration. I've been a vim and neovim user for many years focusing on the core set of vim features with minimal use of plugins (yeah, I know, this is a big change).

This configuration hopefully reflects that, and will continue to do so even more in the future as I whittle down Doom Emacs to a smaller feature set over time.

** Features
Here are a few features of this configuration:

+ Starts maximized but not fullscreen (macOS)
+ Load private information from secrets file
+ Sets a random custom Doom Emacs banner at start
  - Pixelmator Pro template available on request
+ Sets snipe mode to not override =S= and =s=
+ Elixir autoformatting
+ Elixir Language Server support (requires additional setup)
  - I'm still debating the benefits of the full language server verses just using Alchemist which stil provides quite a bit more functionality than what I'm used to in my vim setup (which is basically only syntax highlighting and autoformatting).
+ Vim Vinegar style =-= keybinding to open Dired
