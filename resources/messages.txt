# Please don't leave, there's more demons to toast!
# Let's beat it -- This is turning into a bloodbath!
# I wouldn't leave if I were you. DOS is much worse.
# Don't leave yet -- There's a demon around that corner!
# Ya know, next time you come in here I'm gonna toast ya.
# Go ahead and leave. See if I care.
# Are you sure you want to quit this great editor?

# From Doom 2

# Don't go now, there's a dimensional shambler waiting at the dos prompt!
# Get outta here and go back to your boring programs.
# If I were your boss, I'd deathmatch ya in a minute!
# Look, bud. You leave now and you forfeit your body count!
# You're lucky I don't smack you for thinking about leaving.

Hey! Hey, M-x listen!
I'm the man who's going to burn your house down! With the lemons!
It's not like I'll miss you or anything, b-baka!
Okay, look. We've both said a lot of things you're going to regret...
You are *not* prepared!

# Lews Therin Telamon Quotes (from Lews Therin Telamon Bot https://github.com/Tobuss/Lews-Therin-Bot)

What I love, I destroy. What I destroy, I love.
ILYENAAAAAA!!
# Where are all the dead? Why will they not be silent?
# Distant Weeping
NO! I AM MYSELF! I AM LEWS THERIN TELAMON! I AM MEEEEEeeeee!
# Humming
# Never prod at a woman unless you must. She will kill you faster than a man and for less reason, even if she weeps over it after.
# I am not dead! I deserve death, but I am ALIVE! ALIVE! ALIVE!
Are you real? Am I?
# I killed the whole world, and you can too, if you try hard.
# The dead watch. The dead never close their eyes.
# I would not mind you in my head, if you were not so clearly mad.
# Madness waits for some. It creeps up on others.
# Do you have the Horn of Valere hidden in your pocket this time?
Your plans fail because you want to live, madman.
# Dead men should be quiet in their graves, but they never are.
# A man who trusts everyone is a fool, and a man who trusts no one is a fool. We are all fools if we live long enough.
# Oh, Light, why do I have a madman in my head? Why? Why?
# I told you to kill them all when you had the chance. I told you.
# Oh, Light. That’s impossible! We can’t use it! Cast it away! That is death we hold, death and betrayal. It is HIM.
Trust is death
# Break it break them all must break them must must must break them all break them and strike must strike quickly must strike now break it break it break it...
# The Wheel of Time and the wheel of a man's life turn alike without pity or mercy.
I thought I could build. I was wrong. We are not builders, not you, or I, or the other one. We are destroyers. Destroyers.
# What makes you think you can keep anyone safe? We are all going to die. Just hope that you aren't the one who kills them.
# Why do we live again?
We all have our limits. And we set them further out than we have any right.
# Take what you can have. Rejoice in what you can save, and do not mourn your losses too long.
# The only way to live is to die. I must die. I deserve only death.
# Pride fills me. I am sick with the pride that destroyed me.
# A man without trust might as well be dead.
# You never escape the traps you spin yourself. Only a greater power can break a power, and then you're trapped again. Trapped forever so you cannot die.
# What you want is what you cannot have. What you cannot have is what you want.
If it hurts too much, make it hurt someone else instead.
Nothing ever goes as you expect. Expect nothing, and you will not be surprised. Expect nothing. Hope for nothing. Nothing.
# Break the seals. Break the seals, and end it. Let me die forever.
Sometimes, pain is all that lets you know you're alive.
ILYENA, MY LOVE, FORGIVE ME!
